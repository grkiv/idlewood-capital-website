# Idlewood Capital Website Project

## Project Overview
Website: idlewoodcapital.com
Repository: GitHub (to be connected)

## Working Directory Rules
- **ALL website files** must be saved in: `C:\Users\georg\projects\website\`
- **NO files** should be created in the root directory (`C:\Users\georg\`)
- Use appropriate subdirectories for organization

## File Organization
```
C:\Users\georg\projects\website\
├── src/               # Source code files
├── public/            # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── docs/              # Project documentation
├── tests/             # Test files
└── scripts/           # Build/deployment scripts
```

## Development Workflow
1. Always work within the website project folder
2. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
3. Test changes locally before deployment
4. Document significant changes
5. Never commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials)

## Git Workflow
- Main branch: Check existing repo structure
- Always pull latest before making changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Push changes only when approved

## Style Guidelines
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Keep files organized by feature/component
- Document complex logic
- Optimize images and assets
